print("There once was a man who was shipwrecked on a remote island in the pacific ocean.")
print("He spent most of the day making smoke signals to no avail and chopping down trees for the fire")
print("One day he traveled further inland to discover a group of animals who sounded like they were speaking.")
print("As he approached, he was in disbelief as they were speaking english! They agreed to help him off the island")
print("They helped him built a makeshift raft and he set sail for Hawaii, reuniting with his loved ones")
